# Overview

Welcome! This is the first "computational thinking" lesson, which is about two
topics: writing your own functions and performing iterations.

### Functions:




### Iteration:


------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will submit two outputs for this activity:

1.  A **PDF** of a rendered Quarto document with all of your R code.
    Please create a new Quarto document (e.g. don't use this
    `README.qmd`), include all of the code that appears in this
    document, in addition to adding your own code and **answers to all
    of the questions** in the "Q#" sections. Submit this through
    Gradescope.

2.  A plot and your answers from the final "Energy production" section.
    Submit that content to the google slide below:
    <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AJVu0eq5-OoRGi4UlBervrqKbFHOINvAB-8u0JaFzYM/edit?usp=sharing>

*If you have trouble submitting as a PDF, please ask Calvin or Malin for
help. If we still can't solve it, you can submit the .qmd file instead.*

A reminder: **Please label the code** in your final submission in two
ways: 1) denote your answers to each question using headers that
correspond to the question you're answering and 2) thoroughly "comment"
your code: remember, this means annotating your code directly by typing
descriptions of what each line does after a `#`. This will help future
you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by reading in the relevant packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

```

# 1. Functions

Functions take the form of

```default
my.function  <- function(arg1, arg2, ... ){

  the function's code (body) is nestled between curly braces
  
  return(object)
  
}

```


To create a function, we start by assigning the function a name with the assignment operator, such as my.function <-. This names the function; if the name is omitted, the function is called an anonymous function (functions without names). To save a function, it must be named.

Then, we use the function function (you read that correctly!) to tell R it will be a function. We list the arguments in our function between parentheses and include any default values. These are the function’s inputs. Then, in between two curly braces { }, we enter R code that tells R what to do with the inputs, and what to return to the function user (the output).
